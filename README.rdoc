For Redmine 1.4.X go to {redmine_spent_time-1.4}[https://github.com/eyp/redmine_spent_time-1.4] repository.

This is a {Redmine}[http://www.redmine.org]'s plugin which allow users to add spent time entries for issues they have worked on. 
It gives users a comfortable form to do queries about their spent time on projects, along with a little form
to submit new entries. Of course also it's possible to delete entries and to modify existing ones.

From this functionality a user will be able to add time entries to assigned issues or to issues which he
has already spent some time but are not assigned to him.

2. At the command line type <tt>git clone https:// github.com/eyp/redmine_spent_time.git</tt>.

4. Login and configure the plugin (see Permissions section.)

* Project -> 'View others spent time': Deactivated by default, it allows the user to view the time spent of other members of the projects his is member of.
* Project -> 'View every project spent time': Deactivated by default, it allows to view the spent time of everyone.

== Usage

It's very easy to use, click the 'Spent time' link in the top left menu, from there you will be able to do queries and add entries.
